# Tic Tac Toe

Link: https://ieatburnttoasts.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

This tic tac toe game can be played with 2 players manually or with a bot.

Bot features 4 difficulties:
- Easy
- Medium (High chance of winning)
- Hard (High chance of tying)
- Impossible (Can only tie at best)

Bot difficulty is managed by rolling for a chance to get the bot's optimal move each turn. <br />
The easier the difficulty, the lower that chance.

Player 1 is always X. <br />
Player 2 is always O, and will always be the bot when playing against bot.

Switch between playing against bot and player any time.

## Have Fun!
